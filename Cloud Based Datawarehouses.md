# Can you compare the architecture of both Snowflake and BigQuery?
Here is a high-level comparison of the underlying architectures of Snowflake and BigQuery, two leading cloud data warehouses:

Snowflake Architecture:

- Separated storage, compute, and cloud services - Provides flexibility, scalability and optimizes costs.

- Uses cloud object storage like S3, Azure Blob - Provides virtually unlimited scale. Data is stored in columnar format.

- Virtual warehouses provide compute power - Scale up or down on-demand to match workload requirements.

- Multi-cluster shared data architecture - Data is queried in parallel across multiple virtual warehouses for performance.

- Caching layers like result cache and metadata cache - Improves performance by reducing duplicate computations.

- Time Travel capability - Allows querying previous versions of data for audit purposes. Stored as incremental changes.


BigQuery Architecture: 

- Serverless - No infrastructure to manage, auto-scales dynamically.

- Columnar storage architecture - Optimized for analytics queries. Data is compressed and encrypted.

- Distributed query engine - Runs SQL queries in parallel across hundreds or thousands of machines as needed.

- In-memory BI engine - Allows interactive analysis and visualization of large cached datasets.

- Integrated with other GCP services - Easy to ingest and analyze data from other Google Cloud services.

- Dual access methods â€“ Direct, serverless SQL or using BigQuery APIs and client libraries for programmatic access.

- Machine learning capabilities - BigQuery ML for creating models with SQL on massive datasets.

In summary, both leverage cloud infrastructure for scalability and performance but Snowflake offers more tuning knobs while BigQuery is completely serverless. Both offer innovative architectures optimized for analytics.

# How does BigQuery compare with Redshift Serverless?
Here's a comparison between BigQuery and Amazon Redshift Serverless when it comes to key features:

Set up and management - BigQuery is completely serverless with no infrastructure to manage. Redshift Serverless still requires configuring clusters and workgroup management.

Scalability - BigQuery auto-scales seamlessly to petabytes of data. Redshift Serverless allows scaling clusters up to certain node limits.

Performance - BigQuery offers very high query performance thanks to its distributed engine. Redshift Serverless performance depends on cluster size and configuration. 

Pricing - BigQuery has simple per-TB pricing. Redshift Serverless bills for cluster seconds based on configs.

Caching - BigQuery offers in-memory BI caching for fast analysis. Redshift Serverless doesn't have advanced caching features.

Security - Both offer encryption, VPC service endpoints, and fine-grained access controls. 

Data lake integration - BigQuery integrates tightly with cloud storage like BigQuery. Redshift integrates with S3 but needs ETL.

Analytics - BigQuery has more advanced ML capabilities like BigQuery ML built-in. Redshift integrates with SageMaker.

In summary, BigQuery provides a truly serverless and highly scalable architecture that makes it easier to set up and use. But Redshift Serverless allows existing Redshift users to scale to multiple clusters while maintaining control. BigQuery is generally regarded as more performant and cost-effective especially at scale.

# If my data sources are in AWS Cloud , would considering BigQuery make sense, as I am concerned about latency?
If your data sources are primarily hosted in AWS, then using BigQuery would involve some additional latency compared to using a native AWS service like Redshift or Athena. Here are some factors to consider:

- Network latency - There would be some network latency when transferring data from AWS to Google Cloud where BigQuery resides. Direct interconnects can mitigate this.

- Ingestion latency - BigQuery can ingest data directly from S3 via transfer services, but native services like Redshift have tighter integration and lower latency ingestion.

- Query latency - BigQuery and Redshift have similar architectures, so query performance may be comparable if data sizes are equivalent. Redshift may be faster for smaller queries.

- Data movement - Ongoing ELT/ETL will need to move data from AWS to GCP for BigQuery analysis which adds latency.

- Caching - BigQuery has in-memory BI Engine caching for fast interactive analysis which can offset query latency.

- Costs - BigQuery has very cost-effective scaling. The added networking costs may be justified by overall lower analytics costs.

In summary, if your data infrastructure is completely on AWS, services like Redshift, Athena or EMR will give the lowest latency. But if cost savings and scaling performance matter more, BigQuery brings major advantages that could offset the added inter-cloud latency. A hybrid solution is also possible, putting raw storage on AWS and leveraging BigQuery for analysis.

# How does a hybrid solution work with AWS and BigQuery?
Here is one approach to implement a hybrid data warehouse architecture using AWS for storage and BigQuery for processing/analysis:

- Store raw data in AWS S3 buckets in native format like JSON, Parquet etc.

- Use AWS glue crawlers to catalog and index data in S3.

- Set up scheduled ETL jobs with AWS Glue to transform and optimize data for analysis. Glue can convert to columnar formats like Parquet.

- Use BigQuery transfer service to regularly load data from S3 buckets into BigQuery. Loads can be scheduled and automated.

- BigQuery can directly query the externally staged data in near real-time, without having to import it.

- Use BigQuery for ad-hoc analysis, BI dashboards, and machine learning on the staged datasets.

- Results can be written back to S3 or a database like AWS Aurora if needed.

- Redshift Spectrum can also query S3 data directly, so Redshift clusters can complement BigQuery.

This architecture takes advantage of S3 for scalable low-cost storage, Glue and Redshift Spectrum for ETL/ELT, and BigQuery for analysis over data in AWS. The transfer service avoids manual data replication. The downside is there is still some query latency vs all systems being in AWS.

Other integrations like using AWS PrivateLink to access BigQuery from a VPC can also help reduce network latency in a hybrid setup.

# What AI/ML capabilities are provided by BigQuery?
Here are some of the key AI/ML capabilities provided by BigQuery:

- BigQuery ML - Allows creating and executing machine learning models using standard SQL queries within BigQuery. Supports linear regression, binary logistic regression, multi-class logistic regression, time series, and clustering models.

- AI Platform - Fully managed platform on GCP for building custom TensorFlow models using Python or R that can integrate with BigQuery. Includes tools for data preparation, training, prediction, and monitoring.

- AutoML - Automated ML tool that uses advanced techniques like neural architecture search to build optimal custom models with minimal effort. Integrates with BigQuery.

- Pre-trained ML models - Public pretrained models like BERT and ResNet are available to apply on BigQuery data. Useful for common NLP, image analysis and other predictive tasks.

- BigQuery ML metadata - Capture model metrics, training parameters, input features etc. Provides lineage and auditability for models.

- Kubeflow Pipelines - Streamline and automate end-to-end ML workflows from data preparation to deployment with Kubeflow on GCP. Integrates with BigQuery.

- Looker BI - In-database analysis in BigQuery and easy integration with Looker business intelligence platform and data applications.

In summary, BigQuery provides a full spectrum of AI/ML capabilities ranging from easy-to-use SQL-based analysis to advanced customizable TensorFlow models leveraging Google's deep expertise in ML. The integration enables building models at scale.

# How does a hybrid solution work with AWS and SnowFlake?
Here is one way to implement a hybrid data warehouse architecture using AWS for storage and Snowflake for processing/analysis:

- Store raw data in AWS S3 buckets, like JSON, Parquet, ORC formats.

- Use AWS Glue crawlers to catalog data sources in S3. 

- Set up AWS Glue jobs for any needed ETL/ELT data transformations.

- Set up stages in Snowflake pointing to S3 bucket data locations.

- Schedule loads using Snowflake's COPY command to load data from S3 stages into Snowflake tables.

- Query and analyze the loaded tables directly in Snowflake. Snowflake will access the S3 data on-demand.

- For security, access to the S3 buckets can be restricted to only Snowflake via IAM roles and bucket policies.

- Results can be written back to S3 or a database like Amazon RDS/Redshift from Snowflake.

- For low latency access, AWS Direct Connect can establish a dedicated network connection between AWS and Snowflake. 

- Redshift Spectrum can also provide direct access to S3 data for additional querying.

This allows keeping large raw datasets cost-effectively in S3 while leveraging the performance and scaling of Snowflake for processing. The major downside is the added data transfer between the two cloud platforms.

An alternative is to use Snowpipe to stream data continuously from S3 to Snowflake rather than batch loading. This provides low-latency access within a hybrid architecture.

# How can Snowpipe help in streaming data from S3 to snowflake? Don't we need to use Glue Job/Crawlers for that?
You're right, Snowpipe provides an alternative to using AWS Glue jobs for loading data into Snowflake from S3. Here's a more detailed overview:

- Snowpipe is Snowflake's native data streaming service that can continuously load data from S3 (or Azure Blob) into Snowflake tables.

- With Snowpipe, as soon as new data files arrive in the defined S3 bucket, they are automatically loaded into Snowflake near real-time.

- This avoids having to spin up Glue jobs to handle the data transfer. The streaming is handled natively by Snowflake.

- To use Snowpipe, you create a staging location in Snowflake that points to the S3 bucket location. 

- You then create a Snowpipe definition that specifies the target table and auto-ingest options like file formats.

- Snowflake handles scheduling, monitoring, and parallel loading of the streaming data.

- Transformation can happen within Snowflake queries rather than via Glue ETL.

- You still need AWS Glue crawlers to catalog the S3 data for queryability via Redshift Spectrum. 

- But the continuous loading of that S3 data into Snowflake tables is handled by Snowpipe without needing Glue ETL jobs.

So in summary, Snowpipe provides a serverless alternative to Glue ETL for replicating data streams from S3 into Snowflake, enabling real-time hybrid architectures.

# Does that mean cleansing the data, transformation of data to parquet formats, applying business rules etc can be done directly from Snowflake itself?
Yes, with Snowpipe loading data into Snowflake from S3, you can perform data transformation, cleansing, conversion to optimized formats, and application of business rules directly within Snowflake rather than having to do ETL externally before loading:

- As data lands into staging tables via Snowpipe, you can use Snowflake SQL statements to transform it for analysis.

- You can cleanse data by handling nulls, duplicates, trimming, case conversions etc. using SQL functions and DML.

- Snowflake supports creating columns and tables with semi-structured data types like VARIANT, OBJECT, ARRAY to handle unstructured or nested data.

- You can convert JSON, Avro, XML etc. into Parquet or other columnar formats optimized for query performance using SQL commands in Snowflake.

- Complex data validation rules, joins with dimension data, custom calculations etc. can be applied within Snowflake SQL.

- Stored procedures, UDFs and Snowflake tasks allow encapsulating business logic and transformations in reusable modules.

- For Machine Learning, Snowflake's Python, R, and Java UDFs allow in-database data preparation and feature engineering.  

- Transformed data can then be inserted into analytical tables and shared views for consumption.

So in summary, Snowpipe coupled with Snowflake's native SQL and programming support enables stream processing and transformation entirely within Snowflake, removing the need for external ETL tools or engines. This simplifies the architecture and reduces costs.

# I understand incremental data can be directly ingested into Snowflake using Snowpipe, but what about the initial loading of huge data into Snowflake from S3 and other data sources in AWS Cloud.

You're right - Snowpipe is great for streaming incremental data, but for the initial bulk loading of data into Snowflake from S3 or other AWS sources, some other options are:

- COPY command - Snowflake's COPY into command can load data in parallel from S3 buckets, leveraging integration via stages. Good for loading initial bulk data.

- External Stages - These stages reference S3 locations so data doesn't have to be moved. Query directly in-place.

- AWS Glue - Use Spark jobs in AWS Glue to extract, transform and load data from AWS sources into Snowflake. 

- 3rd Party ETL - Tools like Matillion, Talend, Informatica Cloud can help with initial loading from diverse sources.

- AWS DMS - Use AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from AWS RDS, DynamoDB etc. into Snowflake.

- Load from Redshift - Unload data from Redshift clusters into S3 then load into Snowflake using COPY.

- Snowflake Partner Connectors - Utilize connectors to various AWS services like Kinesis, DocumentDB, Neptune built by Snowflake's partners. 

- Bulk loading best practices - Leverage multi-clustering, concurrency, temporary stages to optimize large loads.

So in summary, a combination of Snowflake COPY, AWS Glue, external stages, and ETL tools can help tackle the initial bulk loading of data from AWS sources into Snowflake to complement ongoing change data capture using Snowpipe.

# How does BigQuery Serverless architecture work. Does that mean we do have to provision any infrastructure like AWS Redshift master/slave nodes, or Snowflake virtual warehouses?

BigQuery has a fully serverless architecture and does not require provisioning any underlying compute infrastructure like clusters or nodes. Here are some key aspects:

- Storage auto-scaling - Data is stored in Google Cloud Storage which expands to petabyte-scales seamlessly.

- Compute auto-scaling - BigQuery automatically scales execution power in response to query demand, without capacity planning.

- Concurrent queries - Queries are scheduled optimally across many compute instances in parallel.

- No configuration - There are no servers or clusters to size, configure or manage.

- Dynamic pricing - Pay only for the number of bytes processed by queries. More usage = higher cost.

- In-memory caching - Results are accelerated by distributed in-memory caching to minimize redundant computations.

- Automatic optimization - BigQuery's execution engine optimizes and parallels query execution plans automatically.

- Streaming inserts - Data can be streamed into BigQuery tables in real-time without reloading.

So in summary, BigQuery's serverless architecture removes all capacity planning and infrastructure management to provide a fully managed analytics warehouse that scales seamlessly. Users just submit SQL queries and get rapid results without configuration.

# For what usecases/scenarios , BigQuery might not be the right choice?

Here are some scenarios where BigQuery may not be the ideal choice:

- Ultra low-latency queries - BigQuery is fast, but not the lowest latency option for small queries if ms matter.

- Many small queries - BigQuery is optimized for large, complex queries. High volumes of smaller queries can get expensive. 

- Dynamic per-user data sandboxing - BigQuery scales across users via access controls, but not per-user schemas.

- Heavy transactional workloads - BigQuery is tuned for analytics. High concurrent OLTP workloads may be better suited to a database. 

- Restricted public cloud use - BigQuery runs only on Google Cloud. If public cloud services are restricted, BigQuery can't be used. 

- Tight cloud vendor lock-in - Migrating from BigQuery to alternate platforms involves data export/import.

- Custom hardware tuning - BigQuery does not allow tailored hardware provisioning beyond capacity levels.

- Reliance on exotic file formats - BigQuery works optimally with Avro, Parquet; complex conversions needed for niche formats.

- Integration with external engines - BigQuery is fully managed. Integrating external distributed systems like Spark requires export/import.

In summary, for very large analytics workloads on Google Cloud, BigQuery provides the scalability, flexibility and performance needed. But other limitations around latency, query patterns, multi-tenancy, and portability may make on-prem or hybrid alternatives optimal.

# Does bigquery provide any streaming ingestion service like Snowflake's snowpipe
Yes, BigQuery does provide a streaming ingestion service to continuously load new data in real-time:

- Streaming inserts - BigQuery allows inserting data into a table row-by-row using streaming inserts rather than bulk loads.

- Automatic ingestion - As soon as data lands in Cloud Storage, BigQuery can automatically load the new data continuously.

- Pub/Sub integration - BigQuery can subscribe to Cloud Pub/Sub topics and ingest data as messages are published.

- High throughput - BigQuery streaming can ingest gigabytes of new data per second in each table.

- Scalable - Streaming scales automatically without any capacity planning.

- Real-time dashboards - New data appears in seconds for real-time dashboards and metrics.

- Load then query - No waiting for batches, queries see loaded data immediately. 

- Atomic inserts - Each message is validated and inserted atomically in a transaction.

- Cost-effective - Streaming data ingestion has the same low storage costs as batch loading.

So in essence, BigQuery's streaming insert capability provides similar benefits as solutions like Snowpipe for continuous data ingestion and eliminates batch loading delays. The key difference is it is built-in and serverless vs. an add-on service.

# If my data is in AWS S3 , how can bigquery ingest the data incrementallly
There are a couple ways BigQuery can incrementally ingest data from AWS S3 buckets:

1. Using the BigQuery Transfer Service:

- Schedule automatic recurring transfers from S3 to BigQuery.

- Configure the transfer to load only new objects in S3 since the last transfer.

- Supports loading new data incrementally based on timestamps, file sizes, etc.

- Handles incremental appends and modifications.

- Built-in validations, transformations, deduplication.

2. Stream new data in real-time: 

- Set up S3 event notifications to trigger Google Cloud Functions.

- Cloud function can format data and do BigQuery streaming insert.

- As new data lands in S3, events trigger streaming inserts into BigQuery.

- Provides sub-minute latency incremental loads.

3. Use Apache Beam:

- Create Apache Beam pipeline to read new S3 data.

- Apply transforms then stream insert into BigQuery. 

- Run pipeline incrementally to load latest data.

So in summary, the Transfer Service provides managed batch incremental loading, streaming insert allows real-time increments via Cloud Functions, and Beam gives code-based control.
