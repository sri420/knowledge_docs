To add checkboxes to every row in the Streamlit AGGrid component and have a "Select All/Deselect All" checkbox in the header, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a custom checkbox renderer function:

```python
def checkbox_renderer(params):
    checked = params.node.isSelected()
    return f"""<input type="checkbox" {' checked' if checked else ''} />"""
```

This function will render a checkbox HTML element and set the `checked` attribute based on the row's selection state.

2. Add the checkbox column to the grid options:

```python
gb = GridOptionsBuilder.from_dataframe(df)
gb.configure_grid_options(enableMultiRowSelection=True)
gb.configure_columns(["Column1", "Column2"], editable=True)
gb.configure_column("Select", headerCheckboxSelection=True, headerCheckboxSelectionFilteredOnly=True, cellRenderer=checkbox_renderer)
go = gb.build()
```

Here, we:
- Enable multi-row selection with `enableMultiRowSelection=True`.
- Configure the data columns as editable.
- Add a new column named "Select" with the following options:
  - `headerCheckboxSelection=True`: Adds a checkbox in the header to select/deselect all rows.
  - `headerCheckboxSelectionFilteredOnly=True`: When selecting/deselecting from the header, only the visible rows are affected.
  - `cellRenderer=checkbox_renderer`: Use the custom checkbox renderer function for each cell in this column.

3. Create the Streamlit AGGrid component:

```python
grid_response = AgGrid(
    data,
    gridOptions=go,
    update_mode=GridUpdateMode.SELECTION_CHANGED,
    allow_unsafe_jscode=True,
)
```

The `allow_unsafe_jscode=True` option is required to enable the custom cell renderer.

4. Optionally, you can access the selected rows after the grid is updated:

```python
selected_rows = grid_response["selected_rows"]
```

`selected_rows` will contain the indices of the selected rows.

With these steps, you should have checkboxes in every row of the AGGrid, and a "Select All/Deselect All" checkbox in the header. The `selected_rows` list will contain the indices of the currently selected rows, which you can use for further processing.

Note that this solution uses a custom cell renderer, which requires `allow_unsafe_jscode=True` in the Streamlit AGGrid component. If you prefer not to use unsafe JavaScript code, you might need to explore other solutions or consider using a different grid component.
