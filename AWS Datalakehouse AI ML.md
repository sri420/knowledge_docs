AWS OpenSearch Service can be very useful for working with unified data in a data lakehouse architecture in a few key ways:

1. Indexing data for search - OpenSearch can index and enable fast searching across large volumes of log data, json documents, csv files etc stored in your Amazon S3 based data lake. This makes discoverability easy.

2. Analyzing time-series data - With OpenSearch's ability to handle time-series data, it can be used to analyze trends in time-stamped IoT data, clickstream logs etc stored in your data lake. This supports analytical insights. 

3) Joining with other data - Using OpenSearch SQL, you can join the indexed data with relational sources like Amazon Aurora or Amazon Redshift to support a unified view across structured, semi-structured and unstructured data from a lakehouse.

4) Visualization and Dashboards - Kibana integrates tightly with OpenSearch to build visualizations and dashboards providing a view across disparate data unified through OpenSearch. 

5) Machine Learning - OpenSearch ML integrates machine learning with search and analytics providing predictive capabilities on your lakehouse data.

So in summary, OpenSearch unifies access across data stored in Amazon S3, enables performant search, analytics, dashboards and machine learning across the different types of data stored in a lakehouse on AWS.
