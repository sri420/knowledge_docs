 # Microsoft Azure Data Fabric is Microsoft's integrated data management platform and architecture within Azure. Some key aspects of Microsoft's data fabric include:

- Azure Data Lake Store - Massively scalable data lake for storing structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. Provides capabilities like data ingestion, organization, metadata management, security, etc.

- Azure Data Factory - Hybrid data integration service to orchestrate and automate data movement and transformation processes. Integrates data across cloud and on-prem systems.

- Azure Data Catalog - Metadata repository and discovery service that enables data source registration, annotations, discovery and governance. 

- Azure Data Lake Analytics - Distributed analytics service for running big data analysis jobs across data stored in Data Lake Store.

- Azure Synapse Analytics - Unified analytics service that provides SQL, Spark and data integration capabilities leveraging Data Lake storage. 

- Common data model - Standardized, extensible data model for organizing enterprise data on Azure. Enables data interoperability.

- Security and governance - Role-based access control, encryption, audit logs and policies to enable secure data management.

In summary, the Azure Data Fabric provides a set of integrated services on Azure that enable organizations to ingest, prepare, manage, share and analyze data through a scalable, secure and governed architecture. It aims to break data silos and provide insights across disparate data sources.


# Here are some key differences between Azure Data Fabric and Databricks platform:

- Scope: Azure Data Fabric provides a broad set of data services like ingestion, preparation, cataloging, querying, processing and governance. Databricks focuses specifically on analytics workflows and ML with Spark.

- Architecture: Data Fabric stitches together multiple Azure data services into a unified fabric. Databricks is a specific platform optimized for Spark workloads. 

- Data processing: Data Fabric leverages Azure Synapse, Data Lake, etc. for distributed processing. Databricks uses Spark clusters in the cloud for processing.

- Workloads: Data Fabric supports diverse data workloads like batch, streaming, OLTP, OLAP etc. Databricks is best suited for ETL, data science and ML workloads.

- Data sources: Data Fabric integrates a wide array of data sources. Databricks integrates well with cloud object stores, DBs, data warehouses. 

- Governance: Data Fabric provides metadata, cataloging, governance across data. Databricks has basic RBAC, auditing capabilities.

- Ease of use: Data Fabric requires stitching together components. Databricks provides a simpler abstraction for Spark clusters.

- Cost: Data Fabric billing can get complex across different services. Databricks has consolidated billing based on usage.

In summary, Azure Data Fabric is a broader data management architecture while Databricks is an analytics-focused big data platform. Data Fabric provides more flexibility and capabilities but also requires more expertise to implement.
