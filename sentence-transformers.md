# How do I use sentence transformers model in python to do link customer records from 2 excel files FileA and FileB based on semantic matching between the fields in respective excel files.

Sure, I can guide you on how to use the Sentence Transformers model in Python for semantic matching. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install the necessary libraries**. You'll need pandas for handling Excel files, and sentence_transformers for semantic matching.

```python
pip install pandas sentence_transformers
```

2. **Load your Excel files**. You can use pandas' `read_excel` function to load your Excel files into DataFrame objects.

```python
import pandas as pd

fileA = pd.read_excel('FileA.xlsx')
fileB = pd.read_excel('FileB.xlsx')
```

3. **Load the Sentence Transformer model**. You can use the `sentence_transformers` library to load a pre-trained model. The 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model is a good starting point.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
```

4. **Transform sentences to embeddings**. You can transform the fields you want to match from both files into embeddings. These embeddings will be used for semantic matching.

```python
embeddingsA = model.encode(fileA['field_to_match'].tolist(), convert_to_tensor=True)
embeddingsB = model.encode(fileB['field_to_match'].tolist(), convert_to_tensor=True)
```

5. **Compute semantic similarity**. You can compute the cosine similarity between the embeddings from FileA and FileB. This will give you a measure of how semantically similar the fields are.

```python
from torch.nn.functional import cosine_similarity

# Compute pairwise similarity scores
similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(embeddingsA, embeddingsB)
```

6. **Link records based on similarity scores**. You can now link records from FileA and FileB based on these similarity scores. A higher score means the records are more likely to be a match.

```python
# Get the index of the most similar record in FileB for each record in FileA
most_similar_indices = similarity_scores.argmax(dim=1)

# Link records
linked_records = fileA.assign(linked_record=fileB.iloc[most_similar_indices].reset_index(drop=True))
```

This will give you a DataFrame where each record in FileA is linked to the most semantically similar record in FileB.

Please replace `'FileA.xlsx'`, `'FileB.xlsx'`, and `'field_to_match'` with your actual file names and field names. Also, ensure that the Sentence Transformer model you're using is appropriate for your specific use case. Different models may yield different results. 

Remember, this is a simple example and real-world scenarios might require additional preprocessing or postprocessing steps. For instance, you might need to handle missing values, normalize text, or set a threshold for similarity scores to consider a match. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
