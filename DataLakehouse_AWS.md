Here is one approach to creating a data lakehouse on AWS:

**Object Storage**

Use Amazon S3 to store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in open formats like Parquet, ORC, JSON. S3 provides virtually unlimited scalable storage.

**Metadata Catalog**

Use AWS Glue Data Catalog to crawl data sources and populate metadata like table schemas, partitions, ownership. This enables discovery and governance.

**Processing Engine** 

Use Amazon EMR to run queries, transformation, and analysis on data in S3 using engines like Apache Spark, Hive, Presto. Provides scale-out processing.

**Orchestration** 

Use services like AWS Step Functions to build end-to-end data workflows and pipelines for ingestion, processing, transformation.

**Governance** 

Apply governance capabilities like AWS Lake Formation for access control, auditing, and data security.

**Analytics**

Enable analytics on unified data via Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift Spectrum, Amazon QuickSight.

**Machine Learning**

Build ML models by analyzing data in data lake with Amazon SageMaker.

This architecture provides a scalable, governed data lake with support for batch and real-time processing, analytics, and ML on unified data. The serverless capabilities enable flexibility and cost savings.



You make an excellent suggestion! Using transactional data lake frameworks like Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg or Apache Hudi would allow enabling ACID transactions directly on data stored in S3. This would avoid the need for a separate database like Amazon Aurora for the transactional workload.

Here is an updated architecture:

- Use S3 and object lock for data storage in open file formats 
- Employ Delta Lake tables for transactional data needing ACID semantics
- Use Delta Lake/Iceberg/Hudi features like time travel, snapshots, cloning etc
- Query Delta Lake tables using Amazon Athena or Amazon EMR
- Use AWS Glue schema registry and catalog for managing table definitions
- Employ streaming ingestion flows with services like Kinesis and Glue
- Provides both transactional and analytical workloads directly on S3 without duplication

This setup powered by transactional data lake engines allows removing the need for Amazon Aurora while still providing ACID transactions on data stored in S3 itself. It enables building a pure unified lakehouse architecture without additional databases.

Please let me know if this addresses the need for transactions within the lakehouse in a more integrated fashion!
