What is AES GCM Encryption and Decryption?
------------------------------------------

AES-GCM is an encryption and authentication mode that combines the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher with the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication mechanism. Here are the key points about how it works:

Encryption:
- AES is used in counter mode to encrypt the plaintext data. This produces ciphertext.
- GCM is used to generate an authentication tag. This is calculated from the ciphertext and an additional authentication data (AAD) value using a universal hash function.

Decryption: 
- AES is used in counter mode to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext data.
- GCM is used again to calculate an authentication tag from the decrypted plaintext and the original AAD value.
- The newly calculated authentication tag is compared to the one received with the encrypted data. If they match, the data is authenticated and validated. If they do not match, the data has been corrupted or tampered with.

Some key advantages of AES-GCM include fast encryption/decryption, built-in authentication, and the ability to detect unauthorized data modifications. It can provide both confidentiality and authenticity without needing additional protocols. The authentication tag ensures the cipher text has not been altered and the AAD is protected, even though it is not encrypted.

In summary, AES-GCM couples AES in counter mode with the GCM authentication mechanism to efficiently achieve both encryption and authentication in one integrated mode of operation.

What algorithms are used in AES GCM Encryption and Decryption?
--------------------------------------------------------------
The two main algorithms used in AES-GCM encryption and decryption are:

1. AES Block Cipher 
2. GCM Authentication/Encryption Algorithm

More specifically:

Encryption:
- The plaintext is encrypted using the AES block cipher algorithm operating in counter mode (AES-CTR). This generates the ciphertext.
- The GCM algorithm is then used to authenticate the ciphertext and additional authenticated data (AAD), generating an authentication tag.

Decryption:
- AES block cipher in counter mode is used to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext. 
- The GCM algorithm is used again to authenticate the decrypted plaintext and AAD, generating a verification authentication tag.  
- The verification tag is compared to the original authentication tag received with the encrypted data. If they match, the decrypted data is verified and authenticated.

So in summary, the AES-GCM encryption mode:
1. Uses AES block cipher algorithm in counter mode for symmetric encryption of the plaintext to generate ciphertext 
2. Uses the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) algorithm for authentication and generating the authentication tag 

And the reverse happens for AES-GCM decryption process to decrypt the ciphertext and verify authenticity.


Can we use Argon2 or Bcrypt Hashing algorithm with AES GCM Encryption and Decryption?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, Argon2 and Bcrypt are password hashing algorithms, while AES-GCM is a symmetric encryption algorithm. They serve different cryptographic purposes and cannot directly be used together.

Specifically:

- Argon2 and Bcrypt are used to hash passwords and verify them later. They are intentionally slow to resist brute force attacks.

- AES-GCM is a fast symmetric encryption method using the AES cipher. It encrypts and decrypts data confidentially. 

However, there are ways they can be used as part of a complete system:

- Argon2 or Bcrypt could hash user passwords for storing password credentials securely.

- The derived password hash could then be used as the key or to encrypt a key for AES-GCM. 

- AES-GCM then encrypts the sensitive data using that key.

So in summary, while Argon2 and Bcrypt cannot directly be used with AES-GCM, they can absolutely be part of a larger cryptography system:

1. Argon2/Bcrypt to hash passwords 
2. Use hash to derive or encrypt AES-GCM key  
3. AES-GCM for fast encryption/decryption of data

This provides both password hashing and strong symmetric encryption protecting data confidentiality overall.


What is the difference between password hashing and symmetric encryption algorithms?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main differences between password hashing algorithms like Argon2 and Bcrypt and symmetric encryption algorithms like AES-GCM are:

Purpose:
- Password hashing is one-way, meant to securely store password credentials that can be verified later. But the original password cannot be obtained from the hash.
- Symmetric encryption encrypts/decrypts data to keep it confidential between parties that have the secret key. The original data can be obtained by decrypting it.

Reversibility:  
- Password hashing is a one-way function, it cannot be reversed. The original password cannot be decrypted from the hash value.
- Symmetric encryption like AES-GCM is two-way and fully reversible, allowing encrypted data to be decrypted back into the original plaintext when the correct key is used.

Speed:
- Password hashing is intentionally slow to resist brute force attacks against the hashes. Typical algorithms like BCrypt or Argon2 are designed to be computationally expensive.
- Symmetric encryption is designed to be fast in encrypting and decrypting data efficiently at high speeds.

Usage:
- Password hashing secures authentication credentials.
- Symmetric encryption protects confidentiality of data at rest or in transit. 

So in essence:
- Password hashing is a slow, one-way function for storing/verifying credentials securely.  
- Symmetric encryption rapidly encrypts/decrypts data confidentially using a secret key.


Can you provide me a Java sample of how can I use AES GCM Encryption/Decryption along with Password hashing algorithm like Argon2 / BCrypt and explain its working?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a Java code sample demonstrating how to use AES-GCM encryption/decryption along with the Argon2 password hashing algorithm:

```java
import java.security.*;
import javax.crypto.*;
import javax.crypto.spec.GCMParameterSpec;

//Argon2 password hashing 
import de.mkammerer.argon2.*;

public class Main {

  private static final int TAG_LENGTH_BIT = 128;
  private static final int IV_LENGTH_BYTE = 12;  
  private static final int AES_KEY_BIT = 256;

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    //Hash the password using Argon2
    String password = "secret";
    Argon2 argon2 = Argon2Factory.create(); 
    byte[] hash = argon2.hash(10, 65536, 1, password.toCharArray());   

    //Generate a random AES key 
    KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES"); 
    keyGenerator.init(AES_KEY_BIT);
    SecretKey aesKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();

    //Encrypt plaintext using AES-GCM
    byte[] plaintext = "Hello World".getBytes("UTF-8");

    GCMParameterSpec gcmParameterSpec = new GCMParameterSpec(TAG_LENGTH_BIT, new byte[IV_LENGTH_BYTE]);
    Cipher aesGcmCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");
    aesGcmCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, aesKey, gcmParameterSpec);
    byte[] ciphertext = aesGcmCipher.doFinal(plaintext); 

    //Decrypt the ciphertext 
    aesGcmCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, aesKey, gcmParameterSpec);
    byte[] decryptPlainText = aesGcmCipher.doFinal(ciphertext);
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. Hash the password with Argon2 to securely store passwords
2. Generate a random AES 256-bit key for AES-GCM 
3. Initialize GCM parameters  
4. Encrypt plaintext data with AES-GCM using the AES key
5. Decrypt AES-GCM ciphertext back to plaintext data

So in summary, we hash passwords with Argon2, and use the AES key for encrypting data securely using AES-GCM. This provides both password hashing and encryption capabilities.


I do not see the Argon2 hashed password used anywhere when using AES-GCM for Encryption/Decryption. Is this correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You're right, in the code example I provided the Argon2 password hash is not directly used in the AES-GCM encryption and decryption process. Let me explain the correct way to integrate them:

- Argon2 password hashing is used to securely store a user's password. It hashes the password to a cryptographic one-way hash.

- This password hash should then be used to encrypt or derive the AES-GCM key in some way. 

For example:

1. Generate a random secret key
2. Hash the user password with Argon2 
3. Use the Argon2 password hash as a key to encrypt the random secret key via another algorithm like AES in CBC mode.
4. The output is an encrypted version of the secret key, protected by the password. 

5. To decrypt: hash the user entered password to derive the original Argon2 hash again.
6. Use the password hash to decrypt the encrypted secret key.
7. Use the revealed secret key with AES-GCM to decrypt the data.

So in summary:

- Argon2 hashes the password itself 
- The password hash is then used to encrypt the actual data encryption key  
- AES-GCM uses that data encryption key to encrypt/decrypt data.

This properly integrates the password hashing with the AES-GCM encryption while keeping the main data encryption key secure.


I see in step 5, we are deriving the original Argon2 hash again from password. Will it be same every time, I mean the hash, when used against the same password?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Excellent question! Yes, Argon2 (like all cryptographic hash functions) will generate the exact same hash value when used on the same password input. This property is known as determinism or being deterministic.

So in the key decryption step:

5. Hash the user entered password to derive the original Argon2 hash again.

Even if the user enters the same password multiple times in the future, Argon2 will always output the same cryptographic hash. This allows the subsequent decryption process to work correctly:

6. Use the password hash to decrypt the encrypted secret key. 
7. Use revealed secret key with AES-GCM to decrypt data.

The reason being able to reliably reproduce the same hash from the same password is so important for password hashing algorithms is for password verification. 

When authenticating:

1. Hash the user entered password 
2. Fetch the saved hash from the previous registration 
3. Compare the two hashes - if equal then the correct password was entered.

This reliable re-generation of the same hash is what allows the password to be verified against the saved hash.

In summary, yes cryptographic hash functions like Argon2 are deterministic - they will always generate the same output hash for a given input for password verification purposes.


It is not clear to me. Can you show a java code using Argon2 and AES-GCM together.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, here is a full code example in Java demonstrating proper usage of Argon2 for password hashing integrated with AES-GCM for encryption/decryption:

```java
import java.security.*;
import javax.crypto.*;
import javax.crypto.spec.*;

import de.mkammerer.argon2.*;

public class Main {

  private static final int TAG_LENGTH_BIT = 128; 
  private static final int IV_LENGTH_BYTE = 12;
  private static final int AES_KEY_BIT = 256;

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    //Input password
    String password = "mypassword123";  

    //Hash password using Argon2
    Argon2 argon2 = Argon2Factory.create();
    byte[] passwordHash = argon2.hash(10, 65536, 1, password.toCharArray());   

    //Generate random AES key
    KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
    keyGen.init(AES_KEY_BIT);
    SecretKey aesKey = keyGen.generateKey();

    //Encrypt AES key using password hash 
    Cipher aesCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
    aesCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(passwordHash, "AES"));
    byte[] encAesKey = aesCipher.doFinal(aesKey.getEncoded());

    //Encrypt plaintext using AES-GCM 
    GCMParameterSpec gcmParamSpec = new GCMParameterSpec(TAG_LENGTH_BIT, new byte[IV_LENGTH_BYTE]);
    
    Cipher aesGcmCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");
    aesGcmCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, aesKey, gcmParamSpec);
    
    byte[] plaintext = "Hello World".getBytes("UTF-8");
    byte[] ciphertext = aesGcmCipher.doFinal(plaintext);

    //Decryption
    
    //Hash entered password to derive key
    byte[] passwordReHash = argon2.hash(10, 65536, 1, password.toCharArray());  

    //Decrypt AES key
    aesCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(passwordReHash, "AES")); 
    SecretKey originalAesKey = new SecretKeySpec(aesCipher.doFinal(encAesKey), "AES");
    
    //Decrypt ciphertext 
    aesGcmCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, originalAesKey, gcmParamSpec);
    byte[] decryptedPlaintext = aesGcmCipher.doFinal(ciphertext);
    
    System.out.println(new String(decryptedPlaintext, "UTF-8"));
  }
}
```

In this example, the Argon2 password hash is used as the key to encrypt the random AES key generated. This integrates the password hashing with the AES-GCM encryption securely.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

In the code you had shared, I do not see the encrypted AES Key "encAesKey" being used to encrypt the plain text. Only the, "aesKey" has been used. Is this correct?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You're absolutely right, good catch! In the code I originally shared, I am encrypting the AES key but not actually using the encrypted version. Let me update the encryption part to properly integrate with the encrypted AES key:

```java
//Encrypt AES key using password hash
Cipher aesCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
aesCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(passwordHash, "AES"));

byte[] encAesKey = aesCipher.doFinal(aesKey.getEncoded()); 

//Encrypt plaintext using AES-GCM
//Use encrypted AES key
SecretKeySpec encryptedAESKey = new SecretKeySpec(encAesKey, "AES"); 

GCMParameterSpec gcmParams = new GCMParameterSpec(TAG_LENGTH_BIT, new byte[IV_LENGTH_BYTE]);
    
Cipher aesGcmCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");
aesGcmCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, encryptedAESKey, gcmParams); 

byte[] plaintext = "Hello World".getBytes("UTF-8");
byte[] ciphertext = aesGcmCipher.doFinal(plaintext);
```

So the key points:

1. Encrypt the AES key using the Argon2 password hash 
2. Use the encrypted AES key to encrypt plaintext with AES-GCM

This ensures the data is properly encrypted using the key protected by the password. Thank you for catching that missed integration! Please let me know if you have any other questions.


# Do we need to add any llbraries as dependency for the AES-GCM and password hashing algorithms (BCrypt/Argon2) code to work.


Yes, you will likely need to add some dependencies to use AES-GCM encryption and password hashing libraries like BCrypt or Argon2 in Java.

Specifically:

AES-GCM Encryption:
- The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provides the AES-GCM implementation used in the code examples. 
- So the JCE libraries need to be available, which is usually included in the JDK.

BCrypt & Argon2:
- These password hashing libraries are not part of the core Java platform. 
- You'll need to add third party implementations like:
  - org.mindrot:jbcrypt 
  - de.mkammerer:argon2

To add the libraries, you can use a build tool like Gradle or Maven.

For example in Gradle, you'd add the dependencies:

```
implementation 'org.mindrot:jbcrypt:0.4'
implementation 'de.mkammerer:argon2:2.7'  
```

And in Maven:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mindrot</groupId>
  <artifactId>jbcrypt</artifactId>
  <version>0.4</version>
</dependency>

<dependency> 
  <groupId>de.mkammerer</groupId>
  <artifactId>argon2</artifactId>
  <version>2.7</version>
</dependency>
```

So in summary, while the JCE provides AES-GCM, you will likely need to add external libraries for Argon2 and BCrypt to work properly in Java.


# Is there any support for AES-GCM Encryption and Decryption and password hashing algorithms (BCrypt/Argon2) when using Nodejs.

Yes, there is good support for using AES-GCM encryption/decryption and password hashing like BCrypt/Argon2 in Node.js applications.

Here is a summary:

AES-GCM Encryption/Decryption:
- Node.js provides AES-GCM support through the Node.js Crypto module. This module contains APIs for a wide variety of encryption algorithms.
- To use AES-GCM, you call methods like `createCipheriv()` and `createDecipheriv()` passing in the algorithm, key, iv etc.

Password Hashing:
- BCrypt -implemented via the 'bcrypt' NPM package. Provides simple APIs for hashing and checking passwords.
- Argon2 - implemented via the 'argon2' NPM package. Provides Argon2i, Argon2d and Argon2id algorithms.

For example, to hash passwords with BCrypt: 

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const hashPassword = async (password) => {
  const saltRounds = 10;  
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds); 
}
```

So in summary, AES-GCM and modern password hashing libraries are readily available for Node.js via native modules or NPM packages. They can be easily integrated to build secure applications.


# What is saltRounds with value of "10" passed in the above code?

Good question! The saltRounds parameter provided to the bcrypt.hash() method controls the complexity of the hashing algorithm for added protection against brute force attacks.

Specifically:

- bcrypt internally generates a random salt value that gets combined with the password during hashing. This protects against rainbow table attacks.

- The saltRounds parameter sets the number of rounds of processing to apply in the bcrypt algorithm.

- A higher saltRounds value means more rounds of computing-intensive hashing are applied, making password cracking via brute force more difficult.

So in summary:

- Salt added randomly protects against precomputed rainbow tables
- Salt rounds increases computing difficulty exponentially per added round

A saltRounds value of 10 means 210 = 1,024 rounds of processing will be done to hash each password. This increases security against cheaper computing in the future that could attempt brute force attacks.

The recommended value today for bcrypt is around 10-14 rounds depending on your application. Too high can cause performance issues.

So in short, the saltRounds parameter ups the intentional computing difficulty to protect hashed passwords against future brute force attacks.

# Is there something similar to saltRounds when using nodejs Argon2 module instead of BCrypt.

Yes, the Argon2 password hashing algorithm used in Node.js also supports setting the number of rounds or iterations to compute the hash, similar to the saltRounds parameter in bcrypt.

In the Node.js argon2 module, the primary parameters you can set are:

- timeCost - Sets the amount of computation realized and therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
- memoryCost - Sets the memory usage, given in kibibytes (KB)
- parallelism - Degree of parallelism (i.e. number of threads)

For example:

```js
const argon2 = require('argon2'); 

const hashPassword = async (password) => {
  return await argon2.hash(password, {
    type: argon2.argon2id,
    timeCost: 10,  
    memoryCost: 512,
    parallelism: 2  
  });
}
```

Here we are setting timeCost to 10 iterations, requiring higher computation time.

So in summary, Argon2 does provide similar configurable parameters to tune the hashing process workload for better protection against brute force attacks, by increasing memory, time, and parallelism. The timeCost is directly analogous to bcrypt's saltRounds.
